After visiting this site at the beginning of this project, the following aims were immediately established: to maintain this sense of open air and to avoid, at all costs, contributing to the claustrophobia created by the busy road. As this project required spatial allocation for wide variety of activities and that a number of circulation paths be choreographed, pursuing these goals proved to be a fascinating challenge.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a ui-sref=somerville><br>[MORE...]</a></p></dl></div></section><section id=monk_exhibitionist><div class=design-div style=background-color:black;height:680px;width:100%><a ui-sref=monk><img id=me1 class=design-pic src=build/assets/img/monk_main.jpg></a> <a><img class=down-white src=build/assets/img/down-white.png></a><dl><a ui-sref=monk class=project-title><dt>THE MONK AND THE EXHIBITIONIST</dt></a><dd style=color:white>Harvard University Graduate School of Design<br>Career Discovery Summer 2013</dd><dd style=color:white>Critic: Laura Haak</dd><br><p class=design-para-black>The two clients for this dual-residence were a “reclusive monk” and a “prudent exhibitionist.” Though seemingly opposites and extremely unlikely neighbors, their qualities as implied through their titles played quite formally on the public and the private. Again, strategically utilizing openings and enclosures in the development of this space left room for the possibility of brief interaction between the two clients, while also facilitating opportunities for the acts of seeing and being seen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a ui-sref=monk><br>[MORE...]</a></p></dl></div></section><section id=tall_room><div class=design-div style=background-color:white;height:650px;width:100%><a ui-sref=tall_room><img id=tr1 class="design-pic tall-room" src=build/assets/img/tall_room.jpg></a><dl><a ui-sref=tall_room class=project-title><dt>THE TALL ROOM</dt></a><dd>Harvard University Graduate School of Design<br>Career Discovery Summer 2013</dd><dd>Critic: Laura Haak</dd><br><p class=design-para-white>This project initiated the exploration of the spatial dynamics and functional potential of the shape of the box.

Using De Maria’s work in particular as a mental precedent, led to experimenting with choreographing the space of the Tall Room, (which must be traversed to get to the Long Room) through what I called “benign obstructions” - objects that don’t necessarily obstruct but demand being walked around. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a ui-sref=tall_room><br>[MORE...]</a></p></dl></div></section></div><script type=text/javascript>
