               This project initiated the exploration of the spatial dynamics and functional potential of the shape of the box. The challenge became about using this simple shape to create the possibility for this tall room to be incredibly fun and social, while also allowing for enough division for practical spaces such as a museum bookstore. The shape of the box had to contain and house, but also entice.
               <br>
               <br>
               Inspired by an internship at Dia Art Foundation that ended shortly before the beginning of this project, the chosen programming for the Long Room was a Museum of Art, and minimalist sculpture from artists such as Dan Graham and Walter De Maria were very present in the line of thinking. Using De Maria’s work in particular as a mental precedent, led to experimenting with choreographing the space of the Tall Room, (which must be traversed to get to the Long Room) through what I called “benign obstructions” - objects that don’t necessarily obstruct but demand being walked around.
               <br>
               <br>
               Collage was used to visualize these obstructions from a planar view and play with the spatial possibilities of the room. This led to searching for more methods through which to make these obstructions dynamic and more vertical, so as to take advantage of the height of the room, but also enhance its potential for dwelling and social activities. Because of these goals, it became necessary to begin conceiving of these obstructions on a much bigger scale so that they would then become inhabitable. The process planar and sectional drawings show iterations of the size and constructions of the box shape that were used to make the space more enticing.
               <br>
               <br>
               In order to encourage a fun and social atmosphere in the Tall Room, strategic slippages in the construction of the boxes were allowed to occur, through extending certain walls or sliding them out slightly. These slippages and the cuts they created were very subtle and served to simultaneously hint at the activity going on in other rooms but also deliberately choreograph the visitor’s path to and through said rooms, leading them ultimately to the staircase.
               <br>
               <br>
               The stairs, discreetly placed along the wall of the entrance to the Long Room, reveal themselves only once the visitors have made their way through the passages created by the collection of boxes. This playfulness that was created through manipulating the simple structure of the box transformed the Tall Room into its own destination.
