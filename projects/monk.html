               The two clients for this dual-residence were a “reclusive monk” and a “prudent exhibitionist.” Though seemingly opposites and extremely unlikely neighbors, their qualities as implied through their titles played quite formally on the public and the private. Again, strategically utilizing openings and enclosures in the development of this space left room for the possibility of brief interaction between the two clients, while also facilitating opportunities for the acts of seeing and being seen.
               <br>
               <br>
               Assigning further personality traits to the clients made for a clearer understanding of how the spaces might work for their respective desires. Imagining that, like the Exhibitionist, the Monk was a bit of a thrill seeker enhanced the potential for fruitful play. He was someone who got a thrill, not from being <i>seen</i>, but from <i>seeing</i>.
               <br>
               <br>
               This project began through attempting to make visual imagery of the words “nesting periphery.” This was especially useful in starting to think about the planar construction of the residences. The idea of wrapping inner and outer spaces around each other, and more abstractly, of a box breaking away from itself into other boxes, was implemented to create these opportunities for minor interactions between the Monk and the Exhibitionist.
               <br>
               <br>
               Working with an assortment of boxes to compose various massing models, and then doing an axonometric drawing of a chosen arrangement provided a method of visualizing some of the desired sectional qualities of the space. Extending this play on inside and outside to the vertical plane would be achieved by creating cuts between and within the house’s levels.
               <br>
               <br>
               In the drawing to the right, we see the floors designed for the Exhibitionist. She enters at the front on the right side, where she finds her eating and living space. She must then walk through a shared courtyard nested within their spaces, to get to the staircase where she must ascend to her generous resting area.
               <br>
               <br>
               The drawing below shows the floors of the Monk’s residence. He enters the building on the other side of the extended wall into his modest resting and eating space. To get to his living spaces, he must also walk through the courtyard, enter the cube, and walk up the stairs.
               <br>
               <br>
               In thinking about the needs of the clients, more circuitous routes for the Monk were established, as he spends most of his time in the residence. He required very little for his eating and resting spaces but deserved a bigger living space. The exhibitionist received the inverse of these. A Courtyard, nested in the middle of the residences, was also created. Each resident must pass through the courtyard to get from their living spaces to their resting spaces, or vice versa. This, coupled with the irregular shapes of the structures and their, at times, extending walls, as can be seen in the planar and Courtyard views above, makes for equal opportunities to be seen, but also to hide.
